Calculator built with ReactJS

Process:

The project was created with create-react-app in the directory of download and a boiler application was created. 

The application has 2 main components:
      Display and NumberPad Components.
      
The parent component created by create-react-app is App.js and each click of a button was passed to the parent to decipher which action to take. Once the button is clicked the answer/result (this.state) is passed into the results component, from here; within the parent , we can change the display accordingly.

App.css which is the style sheet was used to position the output on the screen and make it look more presentable.

To run the application on a local machine, clone first and then run 
npm install
npm start
